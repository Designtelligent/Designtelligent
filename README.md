- 👋 Hi, I’m Arpan@Designtelligent
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things and new technologies on the go, still learning the fundamentals of Node JS and React JS, still a long way to go, yet hoping for an effective collaboration.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of javascript and it's various frameworks. Well aquainted with HTML5 CSS3 & it's derived frameworks such as css-grid, Flexbox, Bootstrap, advanced CSS frameworks such as SASS, SCSS and LESS. It would be my pleasure to involve in projects related to front-end web design. I also do photo-editing, video editing, as well as create new videos for various projects. 
- 💞️ I’m looking forward to collaborate on various projects pertaining to the above mentioned skill-sets. I am still learning and I believe it's a process which never ends and continues till the end of each and everyones life.
- 📫 How to reach me? Hello guys, you all can reach me directly via e-mail.
